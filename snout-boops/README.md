# Snout Boops

A recreation of the interface that was demo'd during the Neuralink Summer 2020 Progress Update.

The interface appeared in the following videos:

## Known limitations

* plot and graph components only support 60Hz
* the floor of the spike graph is not configurable

## @todo

* make the consts configurable by the user and make the plot and graph dynamically update in response
