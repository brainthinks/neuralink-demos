# BMI Service

A tiny service with a single endpoint that generates random data which is returned as a "frame".  A "frame" in this context is defined as a neural lace reading of all electrodes at a single point in time.

My understanding is that the current neural laces have 1024 channels/electrodes and sample at a frequency of 60Hz.

## @todo

* must push updates
* must respond to requests for a single point in time
